# Bug Reports

This is a non-code repository for community raised issues, expecially errors and bugs, 
related to any component of the Paleobiology Database.

This repository is open to the public and is monitored by PBDB developers and project
leaders who will address issues here and, if necessary, move them to a specific code
repository to be addressed.
